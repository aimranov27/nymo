# Nymo Network Core

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/nymo-net/nymo.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/nymo-net/nymo)

This repository contains a vanilla implementation of the
open-standard [Nymo network protocol](https://github.com/nymo-net/nymo-net.github.io/blob/gh-pages/whitepaper.md) in Go as a library.

A simple UPnP-IGD port-forwarding functionality is also implemented for the convenience of the user.

## Implementation

To use this Nymo core library, implement [`Database`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/nymo-net/nymo#Database) and related interfaces. Read [documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/nymo-net/nymo#section-documentation) for more information on how to use this library.
